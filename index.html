        <h2>Chapter 1 – The Hospital</h2>
        <p>I woke up in a small room. The walls were white and cold. The bed was hard, and the blanket smelled strange. I tried to remember how I got here. My head hurt, and everything felt heavy.</p>
        <p>A woman sat in a chair near the window. She had a notebook and a pen. Her face was calm, but her eyes were kind. She smiled a little and said,</p>
        <p>"Good morning, Yasmin. I am Dr. Selma. Can you tell me how you feel?"</p>
        <p>I looked at her and tried to speak, but the words stuck in my throat. I felt scared and confused. Everything was quiet except the sound of the clock ticking.</p>
        <p>"I… I don't know," I finally said. "I feel… lost."</p>
        <p>Dr. Selma nodded slowly. "That is okay. We can take it slowly. Start from the beginning. Tell me what happened before you came here."</p>
        <p>I closed my eyes. Memories came back, like a storm in my head. My friends… adam, ons, Dorra, Rachid… something happened to them. They disappeared. I didn't know where they were.</p>
        <p>I wanted to help them. I wanted to find them. But I felt so small, so weak. I didn't understand why bad things were happening. I felt alone.</p>
        <p>Dr. Selma waited quietly. I felt like I had to tell her everything, but I didn't know where to start. So I took a deep breath and began:</p>
        <p>"It all started after… Everything changed at home. My aunt… Fatma… She is not like other people. She is… cold. She yells. She doesn't care about feelings. And then…"</p>
        <p>I stopped. I didn't want to cry in front of her. But the memories were strong. I wanted to tell someone. Finally, I whispered,</p>
        <p>"…then my friends started to disappear."</p>
        <p>Dr. Selma nodded. She didn't say anything, just wrote in her notebook. Her silence made me feel safe. Maybe… maybe I could tell her everything.</p>
        <p>And that is how my story began.</p>

    <section id="ch2" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 2 – Life with Aunt Fatma</h2>
        <p>Life at home with Aunt Fatma was not easy. She was strict and cold. She never smiled. Every day, she reminded me that I had to be perfect. If I made a small mistake, she would yell, sometimes for a long time. Once, I dropped a cup of tea, and she locked me in my room for two hours. I sat on the floor and listened to her steps outside. My heart beat fast. I wanted to disappear.</p>
        <p>Fatma never asked about my feelings. She said feelings were weak. "You must be strong, Yasmin," she said. "Life is not kind to weak people." But I did not feel strong. I felt small, lonely, and scared.</p>
        <p>I missed my parents. They died when I was ten. Everyone said it was an accident, a car crash. People around me cried and moved on. I tried to cry too, but it felt empty. Sometimes I pretended to be okay, because I was afraid Fatma would notice my sadness and use it against me.</p>
        <p>I learned to be quiet. I read books, wrote little notes to myself, and spent time in my room. I even talked to my parents in my mind, asking them to protect me. I kept these thoughts secret. They were mine.</p>
        <p>Sometimes Fatma would say things that confused me. "You must be careful who you trust," she would say. I thought she meant strangers, but later, I realized she meant everyone, even friends. It made me careful with my words.</p>
        <p>Even though life was hard at home, I tried to keep hope alive. I held on to memories of my parents and small dreams that one day, things could be different.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 3 -->
    <section id="ch3" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 3 – My Friends</h2>
        <p>I had four friends. They were my world, my safe place outside the walls of my aunt's house.</p>
        <p>Adam was strong and serious. He seemed older than he was. He protected me in small ways, like walking me home when it got dark, or making sure I ate when I skipped meals. Sometimes he argued with us, but I knew he only wanted what was best.</p>
        <p>Ons was kind. She smiled even when she was sad. She listened to everything I said. I liked her because she made me feel safe. She always seemed to understand things that others missed.</p>
        <p>Dorra was artistic. She loved to tell stories and draw pictures of strange, magical worlds. Her imagination sometimes scared me, but I loved listening to her. She was dramatic and emotional, but she always made me laugh when I was sad.</p>
        <p>Rachid was smart and funny. He could make anyone laugh, even in bad moments. He solved problems easily and helped us when we were confused. He made the group feel complete.</p>
        <p>We shared many secrets and adventures. We spent almost every day together. We laughed, cried, and promised to stay friends forever. We trusted each other more than anyone else.</p>
        <p>But there was one secret we never told anyone, not our parents, not even our teachers. When we were younger, we accidentally caused a fire in an old shed near our neighborhood. We were curious and did not know it could be dangerous. Someone got hurt in that fire, and we panicked. We helped hide the truth and swore never to speak about it again.</p>
        <p>That secret weighed on all of us. We were afraid of being found out. It was a heavy, dark memory that followed us everywhere. Yet, we tried to forget it and act normal.</p>
        <p>I loved my friends, and I trusted them completely. I thought nothing could ever separate us. But soon, everything would change, and that secret would become more dangerous than I could imagine.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 4 -->
    <section id="ch4" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 4 – The First Strange Letter</h2>
        <p>One morning, something strange happened. I found a letter on my doorstep. There was no name, no address. I picked it up carefully. It was unusual, neat, and written in a hand I did not know.</p>
        <p>The letter said:</p>
        <p><em>"If you want to speak to the ones you've lost, follow the signs. Your friends can help you remember."</em></p>
        <p>At first, I did not understand it. I wondered if it was a prank or a mistake. Who would send me a letter like this? But deep inside, I felt a spark of hope. I hope that maybe, somehow, I could speak to my parents again.</p>
        <p>I held the letter close and read it again. It promised that if I followed its instructions, I could hear my parents' voices. I did not know how. I did not know if it was real. I only knew I wanted to try.</p>
        <p>I kept the letter hidden from Aunt Fatma. I did not trust her. She would have laughed at me or scolded me. I wanted someone to help me, someone who would not make fun of my grief.</p>
        <p>Over the next few days, I looked at the letter many times. I thought about my parents, about my friends, and about everything I had lost. I wanted to believe it.</p>
        <p>Then I started noticing small signs, little things that felt like messages, like coincidences. A word in a book, a song on the radio, even the way my friends said something. It made me think maybe the letter was real. Maybe it was trying to tell me something important.</p>
        <p>I wanted to share it with someone, but I could not. It was too strange, too personal. It was mine, and mine alone. I did not know that keeping this secret would lead to something I could never imagine.</p>
        <p>And that was the start of everything.</p>

    <section id="ch5" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 5 – Adam Disappears</h2>
        <p>It was a quiet evening when I realized Adam was missing. He had not come home after school, and his phone went straight to voicemail. At first, I thought he might be angry with me or Ons. But then hours passed, and I felt a cold fear in my stomach.</p>
        <p>I ran to his house. His parents were worried, talking to neighbors and the police. I tried to stay calm. I said, "Maybe he stayed at a friend's house?" but inside, my heart was pounding.</p>
        <p>I wanted to do something. I could not just sit and wait. I started looking for him around town, asking people if they had seen him. No one had. Each unanswered question made my chest hurt.</p>
        <p>That night, I could not sleep. I kept thinking about the letter I had found weeks ago. Could it be connected? It sounded crazy, but I could not stop wondering. I did not tell anyone about the letter. I kept it hidden, only for myself.</p>
        <p>I wrote in my notebook: Find Adam Don't wait. He is my friend. He is my family now. I did not know what would happen next, but I promised myself I would not give up.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 6 -->
    <section id="ch6" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 6 – Searching for Answers</h2>
        <p>The next day, I went to school and asked everyone if they had seen Adam Some students shrugged. Some said he had seemed upset lately. No one really knew where he was.</p>
        <p>I felt a strange mix of fear and determination. I wanted to help him. I wanted to find him before anything bad happened. I remembered small things. He loved his favorite bench in the park, the library near the river. Maybe he had gone there.</p>
        <p>I went to the park first. The bench was empty. The wind moved the leaves around, and I imagined him sitting there, reading, or waiting for me. I called his name softly: "Adam… Adam, are you here?" Only the birds answered.</p>
        <p>Later, I went to the library. I asked the librarian if he had been there. She shook her head. "I'm sorry, Yasmin. I haven't seen him today."</p>
        <p>I felt hopeless. My mind kept returning to the letter. Could it really mean something? Or was I imagining it? I wanted to believe it was a message from my parents, guiding me.</p>
        <p>I spent the evening making a list of places he could be. I asked Ons, Dorra, and Rachid if they had seen him. They were worried too. We all promised to stick together and find him.</p>

    <section id="ch7" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 7 – Signs in Strange Places</h2>
        <p>The next few days were frightening. There were strange little signs everywhere that I could not explain. A word scribbled on a note in the library: Remember. A song on the radio I had never heard before, one of my parents' favorites.</p>
        <p>I began to write everything down in my notebook, trying to connect the signs. I showed it to no one. I felt that if I shared it, they might think I was crazy. But I had to follow the signs. I had to find Adam.</p>
        <p>Ons came over to my house one evening. She said, "Yasmin, we have to stay calm. We need to think." I nodded. I tried to appear calm, but my hands were shaking.</p>
        <p>Dorra and Rachid joined us. We walked around the neighborhood together, asking neighbors, checking places he liked. Every corner made my heart beat faster. What if something terrible had happened?</p>
        <p>At night, I lay in bed thinking about all the little hints, the letter, the signs. I did not understand them yet, but I felt a strange connection, like something was guiding me. Something wanted me to keep going.</p>
        <p>I whispered to myself, "I will find you, Adam I promise."</p>
        <p>Even though I did not know what would happen next, I was ready to do everything I could to protect my friends. I did not yet know that the mystery was bigger than I could imagine, and that it would change everything.</p>

    <section id="ch8" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 8 – Ons Disappears</h2>
        <p>It was early morning when I realized Ons was gone. Her bed was empty, and she had not left a note. I called her phone, but there was no answer. My heart sank.</p>
        <p>I ran to her house. Her parents looked worried and confused. "Have you seen her?" I asked. They shook their heads. "No, Yasmin. We don't know where she went."</p>
        <p>I felt panic rising. Ons was always careful. She never disappeared without telling someone. Something was wrong.</p>
        <p>I started searching the streets, asking neighbors and shopkeepers if they had seen her. No one had. Each unanswered question made my chest tight.</p>
        <p>That night, I could not sleep. I kept thinking about the letter. Could it be real? I had to follow the signs, even if it sounded crazy.</p>

    <section id="ch9" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 9 – Following Clues</h2>
        <p>The next day, I tried to follow clues everywhere. I looked in places Ons liked: the small park near her house, the library, and the café she loved. Nothing.</p>
        <p>I wrote everything down in my notebook. Small things that seemed strange or unusual: a flyer on a lamppost, a message on a wall, a song I heard on the radio.</p>
        <p>Dorra and Rachid joined me in the search. We asked people if they had seen Ons. They were worried too.</p>
        <p>I felt helpless. Every day, fear grew inside me. But I also felt a strange sense of urgency, like something was guiding me. Something wanted me to keep going.</p>

    <section id="ch10" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 10 – Dorra Disappears</h2>
        <p>A week later, Dorra vanished. It was just like the others: no note, no message, nothing. I felt like the ground had disappeared beneath my feet.</p>
        <p>We went to the police again. They searched but could not find her. I tried to stay calm, but inside I felt like I was falling apart. I asked myself, Why is this happening? Why my friends?</p>
        <p>I spent the whole day searching the streets. I asked everyone I could think of. Nothing. No one had seen Dorra.</p>
        <p>That night, I stayed awake, writing in my notebook, hoping for signs. The letter kept coming to my mind. Could it be connected to this? I did not know. I only knew I had to keep trying.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 11 -->
    <section id="ch11" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 11 – Rachid Disappears</h2>
        <p>Then Rachid disappeared too. It was impossible. I could not believe it. Four friends, one by one, gone. My heart ached, my hands shook, but I did not give up.</p>
        <p>I searched the neighborhood, the park, and even the streets at night. I asked everyone I knew if they had seen him. No one had.</p>
        <p>I started noticing small signs again. Strange coincidences, words I saw on walls, songs on the radio. They made me feel like someone, maybe even my parents, was trying to guide me.</p>
        <p>Dorra's parents, Ons' parents, Adams' parents, everyone was worried. I told them, "We have to stay strong. We have to keep looking." I wanted to believe that hope was still possible.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 12 -->
    <section id="ch12" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 12 – Signs in the Night</h2>
        <p>I could not sleep. Every night, I thought about all four friends. I went through my notebook, reading everything I had written.</p>
        <p>I saw patterns, little things that seemed like messages. A word on a flyer, a song playing on the radio, even the way the wind moved the leaves outside my window. It was strange, but it gave me hope.</p>
        <p>Even though I did not know what would happen next, I felt that someone, or something, was guiding me. I had to follow the signs. I had no idea that following them would change everything.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 13 -->
    <section id="ch13" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 13 – Growing Anxiety</h2>
        <p>After weeks of searching, the fear inside me was growing stronger every day. I could not eat properly. I could not sleep. My mind kept replaying the faces of my friends Adam, Ons, Dorra, and Rachid gone one by one.</p>
        <p>I went through my notebook, reading all my notes again. I tried to see if I had missed something. Every small coincidence the words on signs, songs on the radio, even the way the wind moves felt like messages.</p>
        <p>I whispered their names at night, alone in my room:</p>
        <p>"Please, be safe… I will find you."</p>
        <p>Even though fear was heavy in my chest, I felt a strange pull to keep following the signs. It was as if someone or something was telling me not to give up.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 14 -->
    <section id="ch14" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 14 – The Letter Returns</h2>
        <p>One evening, I found the old letter tucked between the pages of my notebook. I had almost forgotten about it, but now it felt important again. I read it carefully:</p>
        <p><em>"If you want to speak to the ones you've lost, follow the signs. Your friends can help you remember."</em></p>
        <p>I did not understand what it meant. How could my friends help me "remember"? I wanted to believe it was my parents reaching out. The thought both scared me and made me feel hopeful.</p>
        <p>I started retracing small things I had noticed: the words, the notes, the coincidences. Maybe there was a pattern I had missed. Maybe it was a clue. I had to find it.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 15 -->
    <section id="ch15" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 15 – Alone in the Streets</h2>
        <p>I spent the next few nights walking the streets alone. I went to the places my friends loved parks, cafés, the library, and the small alleys we used to explore. Everything was quiet. The streets felt empty without them.</p>
        <p>I asked strangers if they had seen my friends. No one had. I began to feel the weight of hopelessness pressing on me, but I refused to give in.</p>
        <p>I wrote in my notebook:</p>
        <p>"I will not stop. I have to find them. I have to."</p>
        <p>Even as fear grew, I could feel something guiding me. Small signs, like words on walls or objects in the street, seemed to point toward something I could not yet understand.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 16 -->
    <section id="ch16" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 16 – The Disturbing Discovery</h2>
        <p>The nights had become unbearable. I could not stop thinking about my friends. Adam, Ons, Dorra, Rachid… they were gone, and I felt helpless. I followed the smallest clues, the tiniest signs, writing everything in my notebook.</p>
        <p>One evening, I passed by the cemetery. The one that my parents are buried in. The wind whispered through the trees, and shadows seemed to twist around me. Something made me stop near their graves.</p>
        <p>I crouched closer. It was a small rope of something sticky. I panicked when I realized… they were tongues! tied together with string: sticks, a piece of cloth, and a few personal items that belonged to my friends. My stomach turned…</p>
        <p>I stepped back, horrified. Someone had done this… but who? My hands shook as I picked up the bundle. There was something familiar about the way the objects were arranged. Something I couldn't place.</p>
        <p>For hours, I sat there, thinking. I could not understand how this had happened, but a cold realization crept into my chest. The signs I had been following… the strange coincidences, the letter, the whispers in the night… maybe I had been connected to this all along.</p>
        <p>I felt fear like never before. The idea terrified me, but I pushed it aside. I had to stay strong. I had to find them, I told myself.</p>

    <section id="ch17" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 17 – The Final Truth</h2>
        <p>Dr. Selma was calling my name. Her voice was calm but serious. "Yasmin…the police found something important at the murders house ". We need to discuss it."</p>
        <p>I froze. My heart raced. "The murder ?" I whispered.</p>
        <p>She handed me a small leather journal. The edges were worn, the pages filled with writing. I opened it, trembling.</p>
        <p>And then I saw it. My handwriting. Every line. Every word. Every thought I had written about my friends, the letter, the strange signs… it was all there.</p>
        <p>I looked up at Dr. Selma, tears in my eyes. "It… it can't be… it's mine."</p>
        <p>Her eyes were sad. "Yasmin… it seems that while trying to contact your parents, you… you carried out the sacrifices. You killed them yasmin. It was you. You didn't remember at first because your mind blocked it. But the truth is here, in your handwriting."</p>
        <p>I sank to the floor. Everything crashed into me: the disappearances, the strange coincidences, the letter, the signs. It had all been me. My grief. My desperation to speak to my parents. My innocence… a lie I had told myself.</p>
        <p>I remembered the first day at the hospital. Dr. Selma had said:</p>
        <p>"We found the journal at your house… perhaps it will help you understand what happened."</p>
        <p>And now I understand. I was the killer. Every friend I had tried so hard to save, I had lost because of myself.</p>
        <p>The walls of the hospital seemed to close in. My grief, my horror, my despair everything hit me at once. The person who had sacrificed my friends… was me.</p>
        <p>And for the first time, I truly felt the weight of what I had done</p>
