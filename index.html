        <h2>Chapter 1 – The Hospital</h2>
        <p>I woke up in a small room. The walls were white and cold. The bed was hard, and the blanket smelled strange. I tried to remember how I got here. My head hurt, and everything felt heavy.</p>
        <p>A woman sat in a chair near the window. She had a notebook and a pen. Her face was calm, but her eyes were kind. She smiled a little and said,</p>
        <p>“Good morning, Yasmin. I am Dr. Selma. Can you tell me how you feel?”</p>
        <p>I looked at her and tried to speak, but the words stuck in my throat. I felt scared and confused. Everything was quiet except the sound of the clock ticking.</p>
        <p>“I… I don’t know,” I finally said. “I feel… lost.”</p>
        <p>Dr. Selma nodded slowly. “That is okay. We can take it slowly. Start from the beginning. Tell me what happened before you came here.”</p>
        <p>I closed my eyes. Memories came back, like a storm in my head. My friends… Adam, Ons, Dorra, Rachid… something happened to them. They disappeared. I didn’t know where they were.</p>
        <p>I wanted to help them. I wanted to find them. But I felt so small, so weak. I didn’t understand why bad things were happening. I felt alone.</p>
        <p>Dr. Selma waited quietly. I felt like I had to tell her everything, but I didn’t know where to start. So I took a deep breath and began:</p>
        <p>“It all started after… Everything changed at home. My aunt… Fatma… She is not like other people. She is… cold. She yells. She doesn’t care about feelings. And then…”</p>
        <p>I stopped. I didn’t want to cry in front of her. But the memories were strong. I wanted to tell someone. Finally, I whispered,</p>
        <p>“…then my friends started to disappear.”</p>
        <p>Dr. Selma nodded. She didn’t say anything, just wrote in her notebook. Her silence made me feel safe. Maybe… maybe I could tell her everything.</p>
        <p>And that is how my story began.</p>

    <section id="ch2" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 2 – Life with Aunt Fatma</h2>
        <p>Life at home with Aunt Fatma was not easy. She was strict and cold. She never smiled. Every day, she reminded me that I had to be perfect. If I made a small mistake, she would yell, sometimes for a long time. Once, I dropped a cup of tea, and she locked me in my room for two hours. I sat on the floor and listened to her steps outside. My heart beat fast. I wanted to disappear.</p> 
        <p>Fatma never asked about my feelings. She said feelings were weak. “You must be strong, Yasmin,” she said. “Life is not kind to weak people.” But I did not feel strong. I felt small, lonely, and scared.</p>
        <p>I missed my parents. They died when I was ten. Everyone said it was an accident, a car crash. People around me cried and moved on. I tried to cry too, but it felt empty. Sometimes I pretended to be okay, because I was afraid Fatma would notice my sadness and use it against me.</p>
        <p>I learned to be quiet. I read books, wrote little notes to myself, and spent time in my room. I even talked to my parents in my mind, asking them to protect me. I kept these thoughts secret. They were mine.</p>
        <p>Sometimes Fatma would say things that confused me. “You must be careful who you trust,” she would say. I thought she meant strangers, but later, I realized she meant everyone, even friends. It made me careful with my words.</p>
        <p>Even though life was hard at home, I tried to keep hope alive. I held on to memories of my parents and small dreams that one day, things could be different.</p>

    <section id="ch3" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 3 – My Friends</h2>
        <p>I had four friends. They were my world, my safe place outside the walls of my aunt’s house.</p>
        <p>Adam was strong and serious. He seemed older than he was. He protected me in small ways, like walking me home when it got dark, or making sure I ate when I skipped meals. Sometimes he argued with us, but I knew he only wanted what was best.</p>
        <p>Ons was kind. She smiled even when she was sad. She listened to everything I said. I liked her because she made me feel safe. She always seemed to understand things that others missed.</p>
        <p>Dorra was artistic. She loved to tell stories and draw pictures of strange, magical worlds. Her imagination sometimes scared me, but I loved listening to her. She was dramatic and emotional, but she always made me laugh when I was sad.</p>
        <p>Rachid was smart and funny. He could make anyone laugh, even in bad moments. He solved problems easily and helped us when we were confused. He made the group feel complete. We shared many secrets and adventures. We spent almost every day together. We laughed, cried, and promised to stay friends forever. We trusted each other more than anyone else.</p>
        <p>But there was one secret we never told anyone, not our parents, not even our teachers. When we were younger, we accidentally caused a fire in an old shed near our neighborhood. We were curious and did not know it could be dangerous. Someone got hurt in that fire, and we panicked. We helped hide the truth and swore never to speak about it again.</p>
        <p>That secret weighed on all of us. We were afraid of being found out. It was a heavy, dark memory that followed us everywhere. Yet, we tried to forget it and act normal. I loved my friends, and I trusted them completely. I thought nothing could ever separate us. But soon, everything would change, and that secret would become more dangerous than I could imagine.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 4 -->
    <section id="ch4" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 4 – The First Strange Letter</h2>
        <p>One morning, something strange happened. I found a letter on my doorstep. There was no name, no address. I picked it up carefully. It was unusual, neat, and written in a hand I did not know.</p>
        <p>The letter said:</p>
        <p><em>“If you want to speak to the ones you've lost, follow the signs. Your friends can help you remember.”</em></p>
        <p>At first, I did not understand it. I wondered if it was a prank or a mistake. Who would send me a letter like this? But deep inside, I felt a spark of hope. I hoped that maybe, somehow, I could speak to my parents again.</p>
        <p>I held the letter close and read it again. It promised that if I followed its instructions, I could hear my parents' voices. I did not know how. I did not know if it was real. I only knew I wanted to try.</p>
        <p>I kept the letter hidden from Aunt Fatma. I did not trust her. She would have laughed at me or scolded me. I wanted someone to help me, someone who would not make fun of my grief.</p>
        <p>Over the next few days, I looked at the letter many times. I thought about my parents, about my friends, and about everything I had lost. I wanted to believe it.</p>
        <p>Then I started noticing small signs, little things that felt like messages, like coincidences. A word in a book, a song on the radio, even the way my friends said something. It made me think maybe the letter was real.</p>
        <p>I wanted to share it with someone, but I could not. It was too strange, too personal. It was mine, and mine alone. I did not know that keeping this secret would lead to something I could never imagine.</p>
        <p>And that was the start of everything.</p>

    <section id="ch5" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 5 – Adam Disappears</h2>
        <p>It was a quiet evening when I realized Adam was missing. He had not come home after school, and his phone went straight to voicemail. At first, I thought he might be angry with me or Ons. But then hours passed, and I felt a cold fear in my stomach.</p>
        <p>I ran to his house. His parents were worried, talking to neighbors and the police. I tried to stay calm. "Maybe he stayed at a friend's house?" I said, but inside, my heart was pounding.</p>
        <p>I wanted to do something. I could not just sit and wait. I started looking for him around town, asking people if they had seen him. No one had.</p>
        <p>That night, I could not sleep. I kept thinking about the letter I had found weeks ago. Could it be connected? It sounded crazy, but I could not stop wondering.</p>
        <p>I wrote in my notebook: <em>Find Adam. Don't wait. He is my friend. He is my family now.</em></p>
        <p>I did not know what would happen next, but I promised myself I would not give up.</p>

    <section id="ch6" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 6 – Searching for Answers</h2>
        <p>The next morning, I decided to search for clues. I went to all our usual spots: the old park bench, the library corner, even the abandoned playground where we used to play as kids. Everything felt empty without Adam.</p>
        <p>Ons joined me. She looked pale and worried. "Do you think this has something to do with... the fire?" she whispered.</p>
        <p>I shook my head, but I wasn't sure. The secret we'd kept for years felt heavier than ever. What if someone knew? What if they were punishing us?</p>
        <p>We searched all day but found nothing. No note, no message, no sign of where Adam could have gone. It was as if he'd vanished into thin air.</p>
        <p>As the sun set, I remembered the letter again. "Follow the signs," it had said. But what signs? And where were they leading?</p>
        <p>I felt more lost than ever, but I knew I couldn't stop looking. Adam was out there somewhere, and I had to find him.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 7 -->
    <section id="ch7" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 7 – Signs in Strange Places</h2>
        <p>Three days after Adam disappeared, I started noticing strange markings around town. Small symbols carved into trees, odd arrangements of stones in the park, even a peculiar pattern of wet footprints leading away from the river.</p>
        <p>At first, I thought it was my imagination. But when I showed Ons, she saw them too. "They look like arrows," she said, pointing to a series of scratches on a lamppost.</p>
        <p>We followed one set of marks that led to the old cemetery at the edge of town. My heart raced as we approached the iron gates. "Do you think Adam left these?" I asked.</p>
        <p>Ons shook her head. "He wouldn't come here alone. He's afraid of this place."</p>
        <p>We searched the cemetery but found nothing. As we were leaving, however, I spotted something tucked behind a gravestone—a small, folded piece of paper. My hands trembled as I opened it.</p>
        <p>It was another note, written in the same neat handwriting as the first letter. This one said only: <em>"Remember what you buried."</em></p>
        <p>The words sent a chill through me. They knew about the fire. They knew about our secret.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Chapter 8 -->
    <section id="ch8" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 8 – Ons Disappears</h2>
        <p>Two days after we found the note in the cemetery, Ons vanished.</p>
        <p>She had promised to meet me at our usual spot by the river, but she never showed up. When I went to her house, her mother said she'd left hours ago. Her phone was off, and no one had seen her.</p>
        <p>Panic set in. First Adam, now Ons. Someone was taking my friends, one by one.</p>
        <p>I rushed to Dorra and Rachid's houses and made them promise not to go anywhere alone. "Stay together," I begged them. "Don't answer strange messages. Don't follow any signs."</p>
        <p>But even as I said the words, I knew it might already be too late. The person—or people—doing this knew our secrets. They knew where we were vulnerable.</p>
        <p>That night, I found another note slipped under my door. This one was different. It had a single word, written in what looked like charcoal: <em>"Two."</em></p>
        <p>They were counting. And they weren't finished.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 9 -->
    <section id="ch9" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 9 – Following Clues</h2>
        <p>Dorra and I decided we couldn't wait for the police anymore. They hadn't found any leads on Adam or Ons, and time was running out.</p>
        <p>We gathered every strange note, every odd symbol we'd found, and spread them out on Dorra's bedroom floor. There had to be a pattern, a message we were missing.</p>
        <p>"Look," Dorra said, arranging the papers in chronological order. "The first note mentioned 'the ones you've lost.' That could mean your parents, right?"</p>
        <p>I nodded, my throat tight.</p>
        <p>"Then the cemetery note said 'remember what you buried.' That's clearly about the fire."</p>
        <p>"And the 'Two' note," I added. "That came after Ons disappeared. They're counting how many they've taken."</p>
        <p>Dorra's eyes widened. "So they want us to remember the fire. They want us to confess."</p>
        <p>"But who are they?" I asked. "Who else knows about what happened?"</p>
        <p>We sat in silence, the weight of our secret pressing down on us. We'd kept it buried for so long, but now it was coming back to haunt us—and it was taking our friends with it.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Chapter 10 -->
    <section id="ch10" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 10 – Dorra Disappears</h2>
        <p>We should have been more careful. We should have stayed together every minute.</p>
        <p>But Dorra went home to get her sketchbook—she said she might draw the symbols to see them more clearly. She promised she'd be back in fifteen minutes.</p>
        <p>She never returned.</p>
        <p>When I went to her house, her sketchbook was lying open on her bed, a half-finished drawing of the cemetery symbols on the page. The window was open, curtains fluttering in the breeze. There were no signs of struggle, no note, nothing.</p>
        <p>Just like the others, she was gone.</p>
        <p>Rachid found me sitting on Dorra's floor, crying. "We're the only ones left," he said quietly. "You, me, and whoever's doing this."</p>
        <p>I looked up at him, my vision blurry with tears. "Why us, Rachid? Why are they doing this?"</p>
        <p>He didn't answer. He just helped me up and led me out of the house. As we walked down the street, I noticed a new symbol scratched into the pavement—a circle with a line through it, right outside Dorra's gate.</p>
        <p>Another mark. Another message. And now we were down to two.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Chapter 11 -->
    <section id="ch11" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 11 – Rachid Disappears</h2>
        <p>We made a plan. Rachid would stay at my house, and I would stay at his. We wouldn't be alone, not for a second. We'd watch each other's backs until we figured out who was behind this.</p>
        <p>But plans can fail. People can make mistakes.</p>
        <p>It happened when I went to get us food from the kitchen. I was gone for maybe three minutes. When I returned to the living room, Rachid wasn't there.</p>
        <p>"Rachid?" I called, my voice trembling.</p>
        <p>No answer.</p>
        <p>The front door was slightly ajar. On the floor in front of it was Rachid's phone, screen cracked. And beside it, drawn in what looked like mud, was a single symbol: a triangle with an eye in the center.</p>
        <p>I ran outside, screaming his name. The street was empty. The neighbors' lights were off. There was no one.</p>
        <p>I was alone now. Completely alone.</p>
        <p>Back in the house, I found one more note. This one wasn't folded or hidden. It was placed neatly on the coffee table, as if someone had been in the room while I was in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>It read: <em>"Now it's just you. Come find us. Follow the final signs. Or stay and wonder forever."</em></p>
        <p>They had taken everyone. And now they wanted me to follow.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 12 -->
    <section id="ch12" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 12 – Signs in the Night</h2>
        <p>I spent the next hour gathering everything I might need: a flashlight, a pocket knife my father had given me years ago, warm clothes, and all the notes and symbols we'd collected.</p>
        <p>Then I went outside and looked for the signs.</p>
        <p>They were everywhere now—carved into fences, painted on walls, even formed from fallen leaves on the ground. All pointing in one direction: toward the old industrial park on the west side of town.</p>
        <p>The place where it had all started. The place where we'd caused the fire.</p>
        <p>My hands shook as I followed the trail. Every shadow seemed to move. Every sound made me jump. But I kept walking, because what choice did I have? My friends were gone, and I was the only one left to find them.</p>
        <p>The industrial park was dark and silent, a graveyard of abandoned factories and warehouses. The main building—the one that had burned—stood like a skeleton against the night sky, its windows broken, its walls blackened with soot.</p>
        <p>The final symbol was spray-painted on the door: a circle with four lines radiating from it, like a sun or a compass. Or like fire.</p>
        <p>I took a deep breath, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 13 -->
    <section id="ch13" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 13 – Growing Anxiety</h2>
        <p>The inside of the factory was even worse than I remembered. Charred beams hung from the ceiling like broken bones. The air smelled of old smoke and decay.</p>
        <p>I moved slowly, my flashlight beam cutting through the darkness. "Hello?" I called, my voice echoing through the empty space. "Adam? Ons? Anyone?"</p>
        <p>No one answered.</p>
        <p>But there were signs that someone had been here recently. Fresh footprints in the dust. A recently extinguished candle on a makeshift altar. And on the wall, written in chalk, a timeline of our disappearances with our names beside each date.</p>
        <p>My anxiety grew with every step. This wasn't just someone playing games. This was organized, planned. Someone had been watching us for a long time.</p>
        <p>At the back of the factory, I found a door I didn't remember from before. It was newer than the others, with a clean handle and no dust around the frame.</p>
        <p>My heart pounded as I reached for the handle. This was it. Whatever was behind this door would explain everything—or destroy what was left of me.</p>
        <p>I turned the handle and pushed the door open.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Chapter 14 -->
    <section id="ch14" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 14 – The Letter Returns</h2>
        <p>The room behind the door was small and surprisingly clean. It looked like a study or an office, with a desk, a chair, and shelves lined with books and folders.</p>
        <p>On the desk lay a single sheet of paper. I recognized the handwriting immediately—it was the same as all the other notes.</p>
        <p>This one was longer. It read:</p>
        <p><em>"Yasmin,</em></p>
        <p><em>You've followed the signs well. You've remembered what you buried. But memory is a tricky thing. It changes. It fades. It lies.</em></p>
        <p><em>What if I told you that the fire wasn't an accident? What if I told you that someone meant for it to happen? What if the person who got hurt wasn't a stranger, but someone you knew?</em></p>
        <p><em>Your friends are safe, for now. They're remembering, just like you. They're facing their own truths.</em></p>
        <p><em>But to see them again, you must face yours. Go to the place where it all began. Not the factory—the real beginning. Your home.</em></p>
        <p><em>Your aunt has something to tell you.</em></p>
        <p><em>—A Friend"</em></p>
        <p>My blood ran cold. Aunt Fatma? What did she have to do with any of this?</p>
        <p>I folded the letter and put it in my pocket. Then I turned and ran out of the factory, back toward town, back toward home.</p>
        <p>Back toward the woman who had raised me but never loved me.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 15 -->
    <section id="ch15" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 15 – Alone in the Streets</h2>
        <p>The walk home felt like the longest of my life. The streets were empty, the houses dark. It was as if the whole town had disappeared, leaving only me and my fear.</p>
        <p>I thought about everything that had happened. The letters. The symbols. The disappearances. All leading back to the fire, to our secret.</p>
        <p>But the letter said the fire wasn't an accident. That someone had meant for it to happen. Who? And why?</p>
        <p>And Aunt Fatma... what did she know? She'd never mentioned the fire. She'd never asked about my friends. She'd barely acknowledged they existed.</p>
        <p>Unless... unless she knew more than she'd let on.</p>
        <p>I reached our street and paused at the corner. Our house looked normal from the outside. Lights were on in the living room and kitchen. Aunt Fatma was probably reading or watching TV, unaware of the storm that was about to hit her doorstep.</p>
        <p>Or maybe she was very aware. Maybe she'd been waiting for this.</p>
        <p>I took a deep breath and walked up the path to our front door. My hand shook as I reached for the key, but I didn't need it. The door was unlocked.</p>
        <p>I pushed it open and stepped inside.</p>

    <section id="ch16" class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 16 – The Disturbing Discovery</h2>
        <p>Aunt Fatma was sitting in her usual chair, but she wasn't reading or watching TV. She was just sitting, staring at the wall, as if she'd been waiting for me.</p>
        <p>"You're home late," she said without turning around.</p>
        <p>"Where are my friends?" I demanded, my voice trembling with anger and fear.</p>
        <p>She turned then, and I saw something in her eyes I'd never seen before: sadness. Real, deep sadness.</p>
        <p>"Sit down, Yasmin," she said quietly. "There's something I need to tell you."</p>
        <p>I didn't sit. "Tell me where they are! Tell me what's happening!"</p>
        <p>"It's about the fire," she said. "The fire at the factory."</p>
        <p>I froze. "What about it?"</p>
        <p>"The person who was hurt..." She took a shaky breath. "It was my sister. Your mother."</p>
        <p>The world tilted. "What? No. My parents died in a car accident. You told me—"</p>
        <p>"I lied," she said, her voice breaking. "They didn't die in a car accident. Your mother was in that factory when it burned. She went there looking for you when you didn't come home. She got trapped."</p>
        <p>Tears streamed down her face. "Your father went in after her. Neither of them came out."</p>
        <p>I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. All these years, I'd believed one story, and the truth was something else entirely.</p>
        <p>"Why didn't you tell me?" I whispered.</p>
        <p>"Because I was angry," she said. "Angry at you and your friends for playing where you shouldn't have been. Angry at myself for not watching you more closely. And..." She looked away. "And I didn't want you to carry that guilt."</p>
        <p>But I was carrying it anyway. We all were.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 17 – The Final Truth</h2>
        <p>"So who's been taking my friends?" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.</p>
        <p>Aunt Fatma wiped her eyes. "I don't know. But I think... I think it might be someone else who was affected by the fire. Someone who lost someone that day too."</p>
        <p>"The letters said my friends are safe," I said. "But where are they?"</p>
        <p>Before she could answer, my phone buzzed. A text message from an unknown number. It contained an address on the other side of town and a single word: <em>"Now."</em></p>
        <p>"I have to go," I said, turning toward the door.</p>
        <p>"Yasmin, wait!" Aunt Fatma stood up. "It could be dangerous. Let me come with you."</p>
        <p>I looked at her—really looked at her—for the first time in years. She wasn't the cold, uncaring woman I'd believed her to be. She was grieving, just like me. She'd lost her sister and brother-in-law, and she'd been left with a niece she didn't know how to love.</p>
        <p>"Okay," I said. "Come with me."</p>
        <p>We drove to the address in silence. It was an old church at the edge of town, one that had been abandoned for years. The doors were open, and candlelight flickered from within.</p>
        <p>Hand in hand, Aunt Fatma and I walked inside.</p>
        <p>And there they were: Adam, Ons, Dorra, and Rachid, sitting together in the front pew, unharmed but pale and shaken.</p>
        <p>Standing before them was a man I'd never seen before. He was middle-aged, with kind eyes and a sad smile.</p>
        <p>"Hello, Yasmin," he said. "My name is Thomas. I was the caretaker at the factory. I was there the day of the fire."</p>
        <p>He looked at each of us in turn. "I didn't mean to scare you. I just wanted you to understand. To remember what happened. To face the truth so you could finally heal."</p>
        <p>"My mother..." I began, but couldn't finish.</p>
        <p>"Was a brave woman," Thomas said gently. "She loved you very much. She died trying to protect you."</p>
        <p>Tears filled my eyes. For the first time since that day, I let myself cry—really cry—for my parents, for the secret we'd carried, for all the years of guilt and fear.</p>
        <p>My friends gathered around me, and we held each other. Aunt Fatma put a tentative hand on my shoulder, and I didn't pull away.</p>
        <p>The truth was out now. It was painful, but it was free. And for the first time in a long time, I didn't feel alone.</p>
        <p>We had each other. And that, finally, was enough.</p>
